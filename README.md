App Recommender system from playstore using machine learning and python and app using android studio coded in java 
Uploaded documentation for better readability which also includes code
The usage of smartphones has been increasing exponentially.This has resulted in a wide
range of applications in the google play store. We see a lot of applications with similar names and
features and also a lot of malware apps that steal the privacy of the users data.

 Naive users would get into troubles by installing the applications which don’t meet their
requirements and eventually result in wasting up a lot of time and cost of the user.

 To this problem I have come up with a solution and that is “SeWiCo”. This project helps to
predict dynamically a better application that could serve the user requirements based on the past
reviews, ratings, resource consumption, genres, content rating etc, and displays top 5 applications
for a given key search that reduces hassle for the user.

 The project implementation is planned using AI & ML techniques and Big Data Analytics.
